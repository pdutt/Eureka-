# Eureka-

Summary: Eureka analyzes an optimal portfolio of stocks based on rate of returns and co-variance of the individual stock. 
It creates a visual (graph) charting the various possiblities, thus giving the user the option to forgo the recommended
portfolio provided to them, and choose one that better fits their needs. 

THe program uses a co-variance formula (which generates an arbitrary number of weights for each stock), paired with each 
stock's recent rate of returns in previous years to help predict the outcome. Not only that, but it takes in user input 
to help decide how much money the user should invest each month--this is based mainly on age and year of retirement.
